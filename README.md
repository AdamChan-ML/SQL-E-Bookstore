# SQL-E-Bookstore
This is a course project which we are required to design and implement a new database system for APU's e-Bookstore by using Microsoft SQL Server. The project is collaborated with two coursemate, Leanne Ooi Xin Ru and Lim Jia Yong. We have designed the database by using ERD, normalise data, created a data dictionary, writing SQL statements (DDL & DML) and more. More details of the project can be found in the documentation in this repository which is divided into Part 1 and Part 2.
